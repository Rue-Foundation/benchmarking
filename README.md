# Benchmarking

This repository contains benchmarking data about the EVM implementations. 

The data is divided into 

* `raw/` which is the somewhat raw data provided by the various benchmarking frameworks used. 
* `processed/` which is (auto-generated) results from the `raw` data. 
* `scripts/` contains scripts and utilities to operate on the `raw` data. 

## Format

The benchmarking `raw` files should contain

* The actual benchmark data (duh)
* Info about processor and architecture
